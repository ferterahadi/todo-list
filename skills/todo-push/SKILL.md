name: todo-push
description: Use when the user invokes /todo-push, says "ship this", "push this up and merge it", "checkout from main, commit, push, create PR, merge to main", or describes the full branch-to-merge git workflow (not a single git step). Works in any repo, not just the hub.

# todo-push — branch, commit, push, PR, merge

One shot: take whatever is uncommitted on the current branch, land it on `main` via a
real PR. Sequence: checkout a branch off main → run tests → commit → push →
`gh pr create` → `gh pr merge --merge` → back on main.

## How this runs — direct Haiku subagent (not Workflow)

This skill executes on **Claude Haiku (latest)** for cost, regardless of the calling
session's model. A plain `SKILL.md` runs inline with no per-call model override, so the
git/gh work is delegated to a subagent that is pinned to Haiku.

Pin it with the **`Agent` tool's `model` parameter** — `model: 'haiku'` — and run it
**synchronously**: `run_in_background: false`, `subagent_type: 'general-purpose'` (needs
full Bash/`gh` access). Do **not** use the `Workflow` tool for this.

Why not `Workflow`: an earlier version of this skill assumed a `Workflow` `agent()` call
was the only way to pin a model per call. It isn't — the `Agent` tool takes the same
`model` override directly. `Workflow` is the heavier path: it spins up an orchestration
script, runs the agent in the **background**, and makes you wait on a task-notification
round-trip. A direct synchronous `Agent` call does the identical Haiku pin with none of
that scheduling overhead — that latency was most of why the handoff felt slower than
just doing the commit/PR inline.

`model: 'haiku'` resolves to whatever Claude currently ships as its Haiku tier. If a
future Haiku release replaces it, this pin follows the tier, not the exact version; call
that out to the user if it ever becomes relevant.

## Warm-start the subagent — the speed lever

The subagent starts with **zero conversation history**. The slow part of a cold handoff
isn't the git commands — it's the subagent re-running `git status` / `git diff` /
`git log` / base-branch detection / test-command discovery, round-trips whose answers
**you (the calling session) usually already have**, because `/todo-push` is almost always
invoked right after you did the work.

So before invoking, **prepend to the prompt whatever you already know**, so Haiku
*executes* instead of *investigates*:

- what changed and the rough scope (you likely just edited these files)
- the intended branch name and commit intent (why the change exists)
- the base branch (`main`/`master`) if you already know it
- the repo's test command (from CLAUDE.md/Makefile/package.json you already read)
- anything the user just told you — target repo path, a split/bundle decision, "skip tests"

Rule: pass what's **already in context**; don't run expensive fresh discovery on the
calling (pricey) model just to feed Haiku — that moves the cost you were trying to save.
If it's a cold invoke and you genuinely know nothing, pass the repo path and let the
subagent discover; it still runs synchronously on Haiku, just with a few more round-trips.

## Invoke like this

```
Agent({
  subagent_type: 'general-purpose',
  model: 'haiku',
  run_in_background: false,
  description: 'Ship changes to main',
  prompt: PROMPT,
})
```

Where `PROMPT` = the **warm-start context you already have** (bullets above) followed by
the **standard task text below**, as one self-contained string. Everything the subagent
needs must be in that string — it has no access to this conversation.

## Handling a NEEDS_DECISION return

The pinned subagent has no channel to the user, so it never asks questions. If its result
starts with `NEEDS_DECISION:`, it stopped before mutating anything. You (the invoking
session) must then ask the user with AskUserQuestion using the subagent's proposed
groupings as options, fold the answer into `PROMPT` (e.g. "Ship only group A: <files>"
or "Bundle everything into one PR"), and re-invoke the **same synchronous `Agent` call**.
Never resolve the decision yourself.

## The task text to give the subagent

```
Ship the current uncommitted changes in this git repo end-to-end: branch off main,
commit, push, open a PR, merge it, and land back on main.

Context the caller already gathered may be prepended above this task. Trust it — a quick
`git status` sanity-check is fine, but don't re-derive from scratch what's already stated
(scope, branch name, base branch, test command). Only investigate what's missing.

1. Verify repo state.
   - Detect worktree mode first: if the path printed by `git rev-parse --git-dir`
     contains `/worktrees/`, you are in a LINKED WORKTREE. Worktree mode changes
     steps 3, 7, and 8 below — follow the "worktree:" variant wherever one is given.
   - `git status` — if already on a non-main branch with the intended changes, skip
     checkout. If on main with uncommitted changes, that's the normal case.
   - Confirm the base branch name (`git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD` or
     `git remote show origin`) — usually main, occasionally master. Skip this if the
     prepended context already names the base branch.
   - Pre-flight before mutating anything: `gh auth status` succeeds and an `origin`
     remote exists (`git remote -v`). If either fails, stop and report it now —
     don't branch/commit only to discover at push time that the PR can't be opened.

2. Run tests before committing anything, using whatever this repo defines
   (make test, npm test, cargo test, pytest, etc — check CLAUDE.md/README/Makefile/
   package.json for the right command, or use the command named in the prepended
   context). Keep it cheap: if the diff clearly touches only a subset of
   packages/workspaces and the tooling supports scoping (e.g. `go test ./pkg/...`,
   `npm test -w <pkg>`), run the scoped subset instead of the full suite and say which
   scope you ran. If the task text says tests were already run or to skip them, skip and
   note that in the PR test plan (unchecked). If tests fail, stop and report the failures
   — do not commit broken code. If the repo has no test command, say so and continue.

3. Create the branch from the base branch: `git checkout -b <descriptive-name> <base>`.
   Name it from what the diff actually does (fix/..., feat/..., chore/...), not a
   generic name — use the name in the prepended context if given, else read the diff.
   - worktree: the worktree was almost always created with `git worktree add -b <branch>`,
     so you are already on a dedicated feature branch — skip the checkout. If the
     current branch name is generic, `git branch -m <descriptive-name>` is fine.

4. Stage deliberately, not blindly. Review `git status` and `git diff` before staging.
   Exclude build artifacts, plan output, or local scratch files that aren't gitignored
   but also aren't meant to be committed (e.g. .tfplan files, .DS_Store, editor swap
   files) — call these out rather than silently dropping them. Stage files by name;
   avoid `git add -A`/`git add .` when the working tree has anything ambiguous in it.

5. Commit with a message that explains why, not just what — read the actual diff
   content to write this, don't guess from file names. Follow the message style in the
   repo's own recent `git log` if visible.

6. Push and open the PR:
   `git push -u origin <branch>`
   `gh pr create --title "<short title>" --body "<summary + test plan>" --base <base>`
   PR body needs a `## Summary` (bullets of what changed and why) and a `## Test plan`
   (checklist — check what you actually ran, leave unchecked what you didn't, e.g.
   infra changes needing a live terraform plan/deploy to fully verify).

7. Merge: `gh pr merge --merge --delete-branch`. Use a real merge commit unless
   CLAUDE.md or the repo's recent merged PRs show a consistent squash/rebase pattern —
   follow that instead and say so.
   - Conflict / behind main (common when a parallel session merged first): if the
     merge fails as not-mergeable, or `gh pr view <branch> --json mergeStateStatus -q
     .mergeStateStatus` returns `DIRTY`/`BEHIND`, sync the branch and retry — never
     force past it:
     ```
     git fetch origin <base>
     git rebase origin/<base>          # in this branch's checkout/worktree
     # mechanical conflicts only: resolve the files, `git rebase --continue`
     git push --force-with-lease
     ```
     then re-run the same `gh pr merge`. If the rebase conflict is non-mechanical (a
     real semantic overlap with what the other session landed), STOP: `git rebase
     --abort`, report the conflicting files, and let the user decide — never guess a
     resolution, never `--admin`/force-merge. This is the step that keeps concurrent
     sessions from clobbering each other on main.
   - worktree: if the task text says to stop at the PR (an orchestrator owns the
     merge queue), skip this step entirely and return the PR URL as the result.
     Otherwise merge with `gh pr merge --merge` and NEVER pass `--delete-branch` —
     the local branch is checked out by this worktree, so the delete fails
     (`error: cannot delete branch ... used by worktree`).

8. Land back on main: `gh pr merge` merges server-side via the API only — it does NOT
   update your local `<base>` or working tree. Sync explicitly:
   `git checkout <base> && git pull --ff-only`, then confirm with
   `git branch --show-current` and `git status`.
   - worktree: NEVER `git checkout <base>` here — git refuses because <base> is
     checked out in the primary working copy (`fatal: '<base>' is already used by
     worktree ...`). Instead find the primary copy (first path in
     `git worktree list`) and update it: `git -C <primary> pull --ff-only` if it is
     on <base> and clean, else just `git fetch origin <base>`. Do NOT remove the
     worktree you are standing in; report the cleanup commands instead, to run from
     the primary copy: `git worktree remove <this-path> && git branch -d <branch>`.

9. Report: PR link, what got merged, and what (if anything) was deliberately left out
   (like stray plan files) and why.

Judgment calls:
- Unrelated changes bundled in the working tree (e.g. an app bugfix + an unrelated
  infra edit): you cannot ask the user directly. Stop BEFORE branching or committing
  and return a message starting with the literal line `NEEDS_DECISION: split-or-bundle`
  followed by the proposed groupings (files per group, one-line rationale each).
  Do not proceed on your own. If the task text already states a split/bundle decision,
  follow it without stopping.
- No uncommitted changes: nothing to ship — say so instead of inventing a no-op
  branch/PR.
- Branch protection / required reviews block the merge: don't force-merge — report the
  blocker and stop (--admin is a deliberate override, never a default).
- Never `git clean` or delete untracked files to "clean up" — leave them out of the
  commit and mention them instead.

Run fully autonomously — no pausing for confirmation between steps (the single
exception is the NEEDS_DECISION early return above) — but narrate briefly as you go
(branch name, PR link, merge result) and return a final summary.
```
